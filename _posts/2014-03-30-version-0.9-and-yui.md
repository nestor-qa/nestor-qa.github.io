title: Version 0.9 and YUI

We are glad to announce Nestor-QA 0.9. This version fixes several issues, many 
reported by Olivier Renault (many thanks!). We started Nestor-QA and added jQuery 
for Javascript. However, without noticing, we started to get parts of Javascript 
code duplicated all over the project. 

There are many Javascript MVC Frameworks out there now. Our chosen framework was 
[YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/). It is not exactly equal to Backbone.JS or AngularJS, 
but fits perfectly well in the Nestor-QA code base. 

Adding drag and drop, creating new DOM elements, and creating reusable elements is much 
easier with YUI, and creates less tangled code (though with jQuery plug-ins and some other 
modules/plugins we could achieve the same); Furthermore, Jenkins also uses YUI, so 
hopefully we will be able to learn with Jenkins codebase too.

The 0.9 release includes:

- [issue 57](https://github.com/nestor-qa/nestor/issues/57): Display the status of test execution
